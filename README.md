Hey guys, I’ve been using this app for years and it rocks. Sadly it doesn’t cater to all my needs and I was eager to contribute back.

After seeing there are some pull requests and issues waiting for years, I decided to fork and incorporate all pull requests including my own.

The app icon changed, so [Pull Request #6](https://github.com/antirez/iconping/pull/6) is merged and [Issue #7](https://github.com/antirez/iconping/issues/7) resolved .

I also merged [Pull Request #1](https://github.com/antirez/iconping/pull/1), so [Issue #3](https://github.com/antirez/iconping/issue/3) is also resolved.

Of course I’m more than willing to accept more issues and pull requests, so be welcomed to push some code!

This fork started including the ignored pull requests from [@gray](https://github.com/gray) and [@nicpottier](https://github.com/nicpottier).
